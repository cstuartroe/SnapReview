A Shopify plugin to display video reviews.

## Current main objectives

### Authorization on Shopify as a partner

Set up as a public app (OAuth)

### Storage of video on AWS S3

We already have a short file that captures webcam input and displays it in real time.

We need to send it to an AWS bucket.

### Construct site 

We need a site for clients to learn about our product and their customers to record video. Let's do it with a Heroku machine.
